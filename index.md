# Reading for structure
## Step One: Review the title
In this step, you should examine the title for meaning. You want to think about what the title tells you about the thing you are going to read. If there are words in the title you are unfamiliar with, look them up. In addition, identify key words, or phrases,
from the title that will give you additional information about the thing to be read. Why do you think that the author selected this title? What do you want to pay closer attention to as you read? If this is an academic article, please use context clues to further
deepen your engagement with the title. Context clues in academic articles include:
+ Article Abstract
+ Author
* Publication Source (Journal/Book Title--Publisher)
* Article Keywords
## Step Two: Scan/Skim Reading, looking for structural elements
``` javascript
var myVar = "Smart-Skills";
```
### Headings
The most common form of structural element are headings and sub-headings. These are often indicated by a short title or subject statement, placed in **special** *formating* of ~~some kind~~. Note how different organizational patterns are repeated, and remember, many
authors, particularly academics, write from outlines, meaning that both the **heading** and the *level of detail* matter in the writing.
